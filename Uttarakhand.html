                    <h3>UTTARAKHAND- The Land of Unique Temples</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Jagannath Temple</b>: The Jagannath Temple at Puri, UTTARAKHAND is
                        among the most revered Hindu temples in India and is dedicated to
                        Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Being among the 4
                        Char Dham temples, Jagannath Temple attracts hordes of people
                        every year who come to visit this religious site. Built in the
                        10th century, the holy temple is equally puzzling as it is lovely
                        and is known for its unexplained mysteries. <br />
                        <b>Panchalingeswar Temple </b>: Named after the 5 Shivalingas
                        within the temple, the Panchalingeswar Temple is located near the
                        Nilagiri Hill and is dedicated to Lord Shiva which makes it a
                        popular pilgrimage site for the Shaivites. The temple has a
                        perennial stream through which the shiva lingas are forever
                        bathed. According to legends, the shiva lingas were installed here
                        by Goddess Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile whereas
                        another story tells that they were put here by the demon king
                        Banasure to appease Lord Shiva. <br />
                        <b>Ghanteswari Temple </b>: The beautiful Ghanteswari Temple is
                        dedicated to the Goddess Ghanteswari and is adorned with bells all
                        over, which the devotees have offered to the Goddess as a prayer.
                        A must visit place in UTTARAKHAND, the temple is based along the River
                        Mahanadi, and its bells made it work as a lighthouse in the past.
                        Since the river near the temple could get rough and cause boats to
                        drown, the bells in the temple alerted the boats beforehand during
                        strong winds caused by the sound of the bells.

                    <h3>UTTARAKHAND- Bountiful Buddhist Sites</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Kuruma </b>:Kuruma is a Buddhist site as well as an
                        archaeological site in UTTARAKHAND and is among the most popular
                        tourist places of the state. The excavations found an image of
                        Lord Buddha seated in a Bhumisparsha mudra, which is a unique one
                        in the state. The site also contains Heruka, who is a Buddhist
                        deity and has long brick walls made with ancient bricks. The
                        excavation of the site has brought forth rooms and halls which
                        were probably made for teaching and purposes of praying. Apart
                        from these, a number of coins, manuscripts, and seals have also
                        been discovered from the site at Kuruma. <br />
                        <b> Langudi</b> : After the forest of the Langudi Hill was
                        deforested in the 1950s, a number of Buddhist Stupas and sites
                        were discovered making it today one of the top places to visit in
                        UTTARAKHAND. Out of the 34 stupas that were found, the big 5 among them
                        were referred to as the 'Panch Pandava' by the locals but the
                        Mahastupa remained underneath a mound which was discovered later.
                        Near the mahastupa you will find the 34 stupas, carved into the
                        rock surrounded by elaborate carvings. There are also carvings of
                        Buddha in dhyana mudras, the goddess Tara, Avalokiteshvara, and
                        Prajnaparamita. <br />

                        destination is popular for its elephant, cut out from a rock which
                        is believed to be among the earliest rock cut sculptures in
                        UTTARAKHAND! Near the elephant stands the Dhauli Stupa or the Peace
                        Pagoda of Dhauli. The dome-shaped structure has stone panels where
                        one can spot Lord Buddha's footprints and the Bodhi tree, the tree
                        under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.
