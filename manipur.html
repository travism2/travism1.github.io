                    <h3>MANIPUR- The Land of Unique Temples</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Jagannath Temple</b>: The Jagannath Temple at Puri, MANIPUR is
                        among the most revered Hindu temples in India and is dedicated to
                        Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Being among the 4
                        Char Dham temples, Jagannath Temple attracts hordes of people
                        every year who come to visit this religious site. Built in the
                        10th century, the holy temple is equally puzzling as it is lovely
                        and is known for its unexplained mysteries. <br />
                        <b>Panchalingeswar Temple </b>: Named after the 5 Shivalingas
                        within the temple, the Panchalingeswar Temple is located near the
                        Nilagiri Hill and is dedicated to Lord Shiva which makes it a
                        popular pilgrimage site for the Shaivites. The temple has a
                        perennial stream through which the shiva lingas are forever
                        bathed. According to legends, the shiva lingas were installed here
                        by Goddess Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile whereas
                        another story tells that they were put here by the demon king
                        Banasure to appease Lord Shiva. <br />
                        <b>Ghanteswari Temple </b>: The beautiful Ghanteswari Temple is
                        dedicated to the Goddess Ghanteswari and is adorned with bells all
                        over, which the devotees have offered to the Goddess as a prayer.
                        A must visit place in MANIPUR, the temple is based along the River
                        Mahanadi, and its bells made it work as a lighthouse in the past.
                        Since the river near the temple could get rough and cause boats to
                        drown, the bells in the temple alerted the boats beforehand during
                        strong winds caused by the sound of the bells.
